            <h1>What happened when Walmart left</h1>
          <p>When Walmart left town, it didn’t linger over the goodbyes. It slashed the prices on all its products, stripped the
    shelves bare, and vanished. It left behind only the ghostly shadow of its famous brand name and gold star logo on the front wall of a deserted shell.</p>
<p>The departure was so quick that telltale signs remain of the getaway, like smoldering ashes in the fireplaces of an
    evacuated town. Notices still taped to the glass entrance record with perfect precision the moment
    that the supercenter was shuttered: “Store closed at 7pm, Thursday 28 January 2016.”</p>
<p>Ten years. That’s all the time it took for the store to rise up in a clearing of the lush forest of West Virginia’s
    coal country and then disappear again, as though it had never been there.</p>
<p>But for the people of McDowell County – proud country folk laboring under the burdens of high unemployment, low
    income and endemic ill health – even such a fleeting visit to this rural backwater by the world’s largest retailer
    had a huge impact. Both in the arrival, and in the hasty leaving.</p>
<p>Wanda Church was present for both of these book-ends of the Walmart story – one of a few workers who helped set up
    the store in October
        2005 and then gut it 10 years, three months and two days later. She remembers her excitement as they stocked the supercenter for the very first time. In just 20 days, they turned it from an empty
    building into a teeming cathedral of retail capitalism.</p>
<p>“It was amazing what we were able to do, stocking the shelves from nothing to full in such a short time,” she said,
    talking as she waited for her car to be repaired at a gas station over the road from the disused store. As if to
    underline her lasting attachment to the corporation, she was wearing one of her old Walmart T-shirts.</p>
<p>She was there at the supercenter, too, on that fateful day last year when she and her fellow Walmart workers walked
    out of the store for the last time. “We were all crying. It was a sad day for a lot of people. It was a sad day for
    me – I spent more of those 10 years at Walmart than I did at my own home.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Much has been written about what happens when this corporate giant opens up in an area. Numerous studies have shown how it sucks the energy out
    of a locality, beating the competition through sheer scale and forcing the closure of mom-and-pop stores for up
    to 20 miles around. A more pressing, and less-well-understood, question is what happens to people when
    Walmart screeches into reverse. When it ups and quits, leaving behind a trail of lost jobs and broken promises.
</p>
<p>The subject is getting increasing urgent as Walmart rethinks its business strategy. Rural areas like
    McDowell County, where Walmart focused its expansion plans in the 1990s, are experiencing accelerating depopulation
    that is putting a strain on the firm’s ambitions. </p>
<p>Hit hard by the longterm decline in coal mining that is the pillar of the area, McDowell County has seen a
    devastating and ongoing loss of its people. From almost 100,000 in 1950 when coal was king, to about 18,000
    today. That depleted population is today scattered widely across small towns and in mountain hollows (pronounced
    “hollers”), heightening the sense of sparseness and emptiness.</p>
<p>The Walmart supercenter is located about five miles from the county seat, Welch, which still boasts grand brick
    buildings as a memory of better times. But the glow of coal’s legacy has cooled, as the boarding up of many of the
    town’s shops and restaurants attests.</p>
<p>When you combine the county’s economic woes with Walmart’s pitched battle
        against Amazon for control over online retailing, you can see why vast physical presences could seem
    surplus to requirements. “There has been a wave of closings across the US, most acutely in small towns and rural
    communities that have had heavy population loss,” said Michael Hicks, an economics professor at Ball State
    University who is an expert on Walmart’s local impact.</p>
<p>On 15 January 2016, those winds of change swept across the country with a fury. Walmart announced that it was closing 269 stores
    worldwide, 154 of them in the US. Of those, 14 were supercenters, the huge “big boxes” that have become the
    familiar face of the company since the first opened in Missouri in 1988. </p>
<p>One of those supercenters was in McDowell County.</p>
<hr>
<p>“It was a big thing for people round here when Walmart pulled out. People didn’t know what to do. Young people
    started leaving because there’s nothing for them here. It’s like we’re existing, but not existing.”</p>
<p>The words are spoken by Henrietta Banks, 60, who lives just up the hill from the closed store. We’re
    sitting in her front room where she spends much of her time in a hospital bed that has been set up for her as she is
    treated for heart disease.</p>
<p>She remembers the excitement when the supercenter opened. “People welcomed it with open arms, we needed the jobs,”
    she said.</p>
<p>But in the end the idea that Walmart would usher in a new, better era for McDowell County proved to be illusory. Her
    late husband Arthur, a former marine in the US Army who died in 2010, worked as a greeter at Walmart for a few
    years. He took the job largely in the hope of getting health insurance for Henrietta. But he was told that
    coverage wasn’t part of the package, and the couple had to make do with Medicaid. </p>
<p>Their daughter Nicole, 25, is next to her mother holding her hand. She works as a corrections officer in a
    nearby prison, but her dream is to become a therapist.</p>
<p>Given her mother’s health issues, Nicole Banks tries to compensate for Walmart’s departure by seeking out fresh fruit
    and vegetables in the nearby area. But it’s not easy. The nearest replacement store, Goodsons, is too
    expensive, she says. Other Walmarts are an hour’s drive away along Appalachian roads that are as tightly coiled
    as the copperhead snakes that live in the local forest.</p>
<p>Already, she spends half her $1,200 post-tax monthly salary on car insurance and bills, and gas for the long
    drive for groceries eats into the little that is left. So she and her mom grab food where they can, opting for less
    pricey meals of hamburgers or spaghetti instead of fresh salad that takes another big chunk out of her income. </p>
<p>It’s not great for her mother’s health, but then Nicole thinks that’s typical for McDowell County people since
    Walmart left town. She has noticed that processed foods seem popular again; there are long lines again at the local
    McDonald’s.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of people getting sick since the store closed because they’re not getting the right diet. It’s sad to
    me, but bad food is cheap.”</p>
<p>Nicole Banks is the first person in her family to go to college. With a degree in sociology, how would she sum up the
    impact of Walmart leaving?</p>
<p>She pauses to think for a while, and when she replies, she does so with unexpected anger. “It’s ridiculous,” she
    says. “People round here can’t get healthcare. They can’t get jobs and now the good food has gone. We are not
    getting our basic needs met. People are dying young.”</p>
<p>Banks is not exaggerating. Of the 3,142 counties in the US, McDowell County comes in at No 3,142 in terms of life
        expectancy. For men, that’s 64 years, a statistic that, as Bernie Sanders likes to point out, is the same for men in Namibia.
</p>
<p>Clearly, such endemic health problems cannot be laid exclusively at the door of Walmart. But for Sabrina Shrader, a
    community organizer who was born and bred in the area, it gives context for understanding the effect of the
    company's decision, and that of its controlling family, to pack its bags and quit.</p>
<p>“The Walton family are billionaires,” she said. (Also no exaggeration – their net worth is estimated around
    $150bn). “They built a system that just made us worse off, and then they took even that away from us.”</p>
    <hr>
<p>McDowell County forms part of the largest mixed mesophyte forest in the world, a relic of the ancient woods that
    once covered much of North America. Wherever you look, majestic sugar maples, hickory, oaks and tulip trees tower
    overhead, hugging the steep slopes of the Appalachians.</p>
<p>It was into this stunning setting that Walmart descended in 2005 on the site of an old Kmart, like the ship of
    aliens that land in the forest at the start of the movie ET. And there it sat: a massive gash of concrete
    encircled by nature’s beauty.</p>
<p>Peep into the glass doors of the front of the store and you can start to appreciate the brutal simplicity of the
    Walmart concept. There is nothing inside its windowless walls, just 103,000sq ft of air. A Walmart supercenter is no
    more, no less than the name implies. A big box, an empty stage on which to wave a magic wand and summon up a million
    retail dreams.</p>
<p>Pack it with 80,000 products, and the people will come. Not just from all over McDowell County, but from far beyond.
    Over the 10 short years of the store's existence, many of those people grew dependent on it in so many ways.
</p>
<p>Top of the list of dependencies: jobs. </p>
<hr />
<p>“It’s all about jobs,” says Melissa Nester, publisher of the local newspaper, The Welch News, which sells 4,500
    copies three times a week and obstinately refuses to have a website. “Dollar stores have picked up some of the trade
    left by Walmart, but they haven’t created many jobs.”</p>
<p>At its zenith, Walmart employed 300 people in the McDowell County supercenter. That was down to roughly 140 by the end,
    but it still made it the largest employer in the area. </p>
<p>Wanda Church has been unemployed since that day when she weeped as Walmart’s doors were shuttered for the last time; the
    company offered her a night-time shift at the next store along, but she couldn’t stomach the hour’s drive either way and
    wasn’t prepared to leave her home. Other employees felt they had no choice and are either commuting long distances
    or have relocated to work at other Walmart outlets, some as far off as Myrtle Beach in South Carolina, some 375
    miles away.</p>
<p>There were second-order effects, too, for local businesses that used to tender to workers and shoppers drawn into the
    area by the supercenter. Restaurants in a radius of several miles from the store complain of empty tables, while
    houses and shops in its immediate vicinity are now up for sale.</p>
<p>“It has affected this place real much, nobody stays here no more,” says Jessie Swims, 67, sitting on a bench at the
    Big Four motel across the road from the supercenter, drinking a soda. Swims has lived in one of the motel’s 15 rooms
    for the past five years, paying $600 a month out of his retirement money. Big Four used to be full, he says, now
    most of the rooms are empty and it too has been put on the market.</p>
<p>After jobs, taxes are the next things to go. The town of Kimball in which the supercenter is located used to receive
    $145,000 a year in taxes from Walmart, and when that went it had to cut back its workforce and put all remaining
    staff on a four-day week.</p>
<p>The county government also lost $68,000 in taxes, most of which went to schools, and all its staff were given a 10%
    pay cut. “All Walmart was interested in was how many millions of dollars they made, they weren’t interested in
    helping the community,” says McDowell County commissioner Gordon Lambert. “When they didn’t make the profit they
    wanted, they left.”</p>
<p>Walmart’s total
        revenue in the year in which the company closed the McDowell County store was $485.9bn.</p>
<p>I asked Walmart why it vacated McDowell County. A spokeswoman said that closing a store was never easy, but it was “a
    necessity for keeping a nationwide business healthy and positioned for future growth”. A number of factors had driven this
    particular decision, she said, including “financial performance as well as strategic alignment with long-term
    plans”. </p>
<p>The company had worked with all the employees who had lost their jobs to find them suitable transfers or give them
    severance pay. “We look forward to continuing to serve our Kimball area customers when they visit our stores in
    Bluefield, Princeton and MacArthur,” she said, (without referencing the hour’s drive.) </p>
<hr>
<p>Economic losses are only one aspect of the hurt felt locally as a result of Walmart’s passing. There is something
    intangible, less material – and more chilling – about the fallout, something that seems to flow from the dependency
    the people of McDowell County developed on the retail magic conjured up inside that big box.</p>
<p>It’s touched upon by Wanda Church when she attempts to explain why she grieved that day. It was because, she says, she
    lost her family when Walmart closed.</p>
<p>Her family?</p>
<p>“The people I worked alongside, I relied on them if I needed help. The customers, they were our family.”</p>
<p>You hear it from Darrell Williams, 42, a truck driver picking wild raspberries on the side of the road to prepare a
    fruit cobbler. He recalls that his twin boys acquired their nicknames inside the supercenter. “My kids grew up in
    there. They called them the Screamers, because they used to scream if they didn’t get what they wanted.”</p>
<p>For Dan Phillips, Walmart was a way of coping with bereavement after his wife died a few years ago. “If you were
    lonely and had nothing to do, you’d go to Walmart to talk to folk. It was a great social network.”</p>
<p>Being a schoolteacher, Phillips has a theory for what happened when the store closed. “Socialization. We lost our
    socialization factor. Now it’s hard to keep track of people, there’s no other place like it where you can stand and
    chat.”</p>
<p>There was something else Phillips lost with Walmart’s departure. To illustrate the point, he reaches into his red
    pick-up truck and pulls out a loaded Para Ordnance Warthog .45 handgun and waves it at us, telling us not to freak
    as the safety is on.</p>
<p>“Bought this in the Walmart parking lot,” he says. “Guy sees me reading a gun magazine and asks me was I carrying. He
    offered to sell me the Para Warthog and I got it for $775.” Phillips took his new possession home and added to his
    collection of 140 firearms.</p>
<p>“They screwed us real hard by leaving us like that,” he says, reflecting on the various ways his life has changed.
    “It’s so sad they thought they could just walk away.”</p>
<hr>
<p>There are some glimmers of hope piercing through the dense ancient forest of McDowell County. Some families are trying to
    avoid the long-drawn-out drive to alternative outlets and the substantial prices by growing their own food.</p>
<p>In a hollow on Hensley Mountain, Alma McNelly, 53, affectionately known as “Maw”, and her husband Randy or “Paw”,
    live with 11 chihuahuas, a cockerel who wakes them at 5am every day and a horse called Snowman. Maw grows
    cauliflowers, tomatoes, carrots and strawberries. She shares the produce out to friends and family at the end of the
    pay month when times are lean and people start to go hungry.</p>
<p>She also collects six eggs a day from her brood of wyandotte hens. The only downside is that Paw doesn’t trust
    fresh-laid eggs unless they’re pickled, so she still has to make a monthly run to a supermarket to get
    factory-farmed eggs.</p>
<p>Down the road, Deana Lucion, 29, six months pregnant and with her 18-month-old daughter Trinity in her arms, tells us
    that she has started cultivating cucumbers, squash, peppers and corn. Her husband Phillip Lucion, 35, also supplements
    his income as a mechanic in a coalmine by catching trout in the nearby lake.</p>
<p>They make ends meet, but to the couple it’s a constant exertion. “We do live in a great place,” Phillip says, “but I feel
    like a slave sometimes.”</p>
<p>When things get really rough at the end of the month – the money has run out, there are no food stamps left and the
    petrol tank is dry – people can always turn to the local food bank Five Loaves and Two
        Fishes run by Linda McKinney and her son Joel. On the third Saturday of the month they supply canned food
    and daily necessities such as toilet paper to up to 150 people who often sleep in their cars in the parking lot
    overnight to guarantee they receive help.</p>
<p>For the last two years of its existence, the Walmart supercenter gave the food bank close to 200,000lb of
    meat, dairy, pies and bread. This had allowed the McKinneys to increase the frequency of their giving. Now that’s gone, they
    try to compensate for the sharp shortfall by growing tomatoes, arugula and peppers in a greenhouse.</p>
<p>Linda McKinney says that fresh food they got from Walmart, or “waste” as the corporation classed it, is
    sorely missed. But, like many of the other residents of McDowell County, she says she also mourns the communal
    aspect of the supercenter, its quality as a “social hub”.</p>
<p>McKinney rattles off a list of all the community facilities that vanished from the region in recent years as the
    population shrank and the culture of mega-chains like Walmart took root.</p>
<p>There used to be 28 churches of her United Methodist denomination in the county, now there are six; there were seven
    bars in Welch, all but one have closed; there were three cinemas, now it’s down to one; there are no community
    centers left; many of the corner shops have gone. “There’s nothing here,” McKinney says.</p>
<p>McKinney has one other, rather astonishing, reason to be sad that the store closed. Walking.</p>
<p>Walking?</p>
<p>“I went to Walmart for the walk,” she says. “I went early and I got a cart and I walked all over the store. I loved
    walking around it. I would walk and talk, talk and walk. I could walk the store all day.”</p>
<p>That’s a statement that will reverberate far beyond the boundaries of McDowell County, or West Virginia. It could be
    applied to small towns and rural areas right across the US. This is the statement of communities that have had the
    communal bled out of them.</p>
<p>Filling the void, as well as helping to create it, came a sparkling new phenomenon: a big box, 103,000 square feet of
    windowless air, where you could catch up with friends, trade guns, shop to your heart’s content and even take a
    hike, all within a concrete gash carved out of one of the world’s most breathtakingly beautiful ancient forests.
</p>
<p>And now that too is gone.</p>
