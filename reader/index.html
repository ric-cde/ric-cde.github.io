            <h1>The Rise and Fall of Getting Things Done</h1>
        <p>was just finishing what was likely the final mowing of my lawn, just before the winter came. As I looked up, I noticed my neighbor was sitting in his truck across the road, watching me as he smoked a cigarette.

            Just a few years earlier, at age 23, I had purchased an abandoned house in Detroit from a live auction for $500, less than the price of a decent television. It had been empty for more than a decade and was still a shell, its bones exposed, anything of value stolen long ago.
            
            The structure was filled with trash and had lived a hard life: two monstrous stories of no doors or windows, plumbing, or electricity – nothing. The backyard was a literal jungle, the porch needed to be ripped off and done again, the front yard looked like it wanted to be cut with a scythe.
            
            When I bought it in 2009, a white kid in Detroit was strange. Most people, white and black, were moving out. By this time I’d been working on the house for five years.
            
            I’d removed the trash – nearly ten thousand pounds of it – added windows and electricity and all the other accoutrements, and had begun to carefully insert myself into the chorus of Detroit among my neighbors. Both my house, and the neighborhood, were starting to feel like home. But during those eight years I’d lived in the city, a massive change had begun, Detroit was growing, shifting, molting. Old grudges clashed with new ideas and nowhere was America’s fight for its soul more clear than in what was the Motor City.
            
            During that time some people had begun to speak of Detroit as a “blank canvas,” a playground for young white kids like myself. I felt uneasy about this.
            
            What I’d learned from those eight years was that there were still 700,000 people living in Detroit, with their own ideas about what it should become. There was a community already here, not a grotesque one that needed changing as I had been told, but a powerful and innovative one I wanted to assimilate into.
            
            I had inadvertently stepped into a real community, one tied together with memory and friendships, history, shared experience and relationships, and it was facing a new threat, one arguably greater than all the fires and crime of the past decades: the auction I had purchased my house in still ran each year, now live via the internet, and it wasn’t just abandoned houses they were selling.

            When the mower went quiet, my neighbor Woods, still sitting in his truck, called me over.
            
            “What’s up?”
            
            “Climb in here a second.”
            
            I sat in the passenger seat and lit my own.
            
            “Did you check the auction for that abandoned house next to yours this year?” Woods asked.
            
            “Yeah. It wasn’t on there.” Whoever owned the LLC had paid the taxes, or something more nefarious was going on, always a possibility in Detroit.
            
            “Did you notice anything else on the auction?”
            
            “No, not really.”
            
            “The Terrys’ house is going up for sale.”

            They were the neighbors behind me, and aside from a single woman, the only others on the block. My first friends among neighbors, the elderly couple had always been kind to me, invited me to barbecues, gave me advice about navigating the neighborhood, and personified the Biblical directive about how to treat your neighbors, even ones who were strange white kids banging on filthy houses.
            
            The woman of the house was rotund and had some trouble walking. She said she had worked as an elementary teacher in the Detroit public schools for 30 years, and her husband put in 30 at the Ford River Rouge Plant as a maintenance man. They had inhabited their house as long, and by this time owned it outright. They lived their own version of the American Dream in a crumbling America, but had no plans to move anywhere else. Now they were in trouble – the only home they’d known for the last 30 years would be sold to the highest bidder.
            
            “What, how?”
            
            Between 2005 and 2007, 67,000 houses went into mortgage foreclosure in Detroit. That was the beginning of the problem
            “I don’t think the missus knows. The house is registered in the old man’s name, and he hasn’t been all there for a while.” He tapped his temple. “The dementia. I doubt she has any idea they’re behind.”
            
            “So did you tell them?”
            
            “No, not yet. You know she doesn’t have any money and you know she ain’t no good at the Internet.”
            
            “When are you going to tell her?”
            
            “I wanted to talk to you first. I have an idea. You have any money?”
            
            “Some.”
            
            “I’ll talk to her, but we might need to buy that house back. They’ve been great neighbors, and I would hate to lose them. I think we’ll be able to get it back for $500, but we have to put a $2,000 deposit down to make any bids at all. I don’t think anyone would bid on that house. We can split it 50/50, and we can put it in her name, so she gets the bills.”
            
            I thought of all the barbecues I had been to at her place, all the times she’d offered encouragement, watched over me while I was working, and the first day I’d met her, when she’d given me, a stranger, a drink on a hot day.
            
            “Oh, Jesus,” I sighed. “Yeah, I guess I would be able to do it. Just $250?” I lit another cigarette. “All right, sure. I can probably come up with that. You talk to her, though, and see what she has to say.”
            
            On the day of the auction, someone had placed a $500 bid on the house.
            
            I’d been watching the sale in the weeks leading up to the final countdown and couldn’t believe it. I sat there looking at the computer for a moment. This was going to be much more complicated, and maybe way more expensive than I had hoped.
            
            I placed a bid of $600.
            
            Just between 2005 and 2007, 67,000 houses went into mortgage foreclosure in Detroit. That was the beginning of the problem. Between 2011 and 2015, Wayne Country had foreclosed on nearly one in every four homes in Detroit for nonpayment of property taxes. Not only did the forced sales leave many homeless, they further decimated Detroit’s tax base, one of the crucial factors in a municipal bankruptcy that people had begun to whisper about but no one thought could actually happen. The Terrys’ house was now one of them.
            
            When I was looking for my place, aside from the abandoned houses that looked like they had been through war, I also looked into some move-in-ready foreclosures, pert brick homes in Detroit’s stable and well-populated areas. I could have purchased many of these for less than $3,000. I just couldn’t bring myself to profit from someone else’s misery. All I could think of were the families once living in these homes and the day the banks and sheriff put them on the street. Apparently whoever was bidding on the Terrys’ didn’t feel the same.
            
            I called Woods to let him know someone was bidding against us, and we decided not to tell Terry. I made some calls to see if there was any way I could find out who the opposing bidder was, and explain to them the situation. There was nothing. Whereas before you could see, in real time, who was bidding on properties, just that year the county had stopped it. I guess some speculators were a bit nervous about all the attention they made buying up homes, including those of people who live in them and had owned them for more than 30 years.
            
            I emailed everyone I knew and splashed social media with a plea that if anyone was, or knew who was, bidding on this particular house to contact me so I could explain.
            
            No one knew. I did receive a huge outpouring of support from the internet, though. People who I barely knew or didn’t know at all offered to donate money. Volunteers from different states, and even different countries, offered to help in any way they could. The first Latina city council member in Detroit, Raquel Castañeda-Lopez, called me asking if she could help. Friends that I hadn’t spoken to in years phoned me, asking to donate or pitch in somehow. One gentleman in London, a graphic designer, made a flyer from what I had written and tailored it to Twitter. I’d never heard of him before and haven’t since. He just sent it to me and asked for nothing. Unfortunately I didn’t have any infrastructure to take donations and the bidding price hadn’t moved. I was still the top bidder, and I was hoping it would hold out.
            
            On the day of the auction I told Woods to be on standby near the phone while he was at work, in case something happened. There were 30 minutes left to closing, and if the price stayed the same, the Terrys’ house would be safe. At 15 minutes I thought we were home free. Surely whoever had placed the first bid recognized the house was occupied and the better angels of their nature had prevailed.
            
            Ten minutes.
            
            Five minutes.
            
            A bid.
            
            I moved to Detroit with no friends, no job and no money. I just came, blind. Nearly anyone I told I was moving to the city thought it was a terrible idea, that I was throwing my life away. I was close to graduating from the University of Michigan, one of the best universities in the world, and I was a bit of an anomaly there, too.
            
            Aside from an uncle, I’m the oldest male member of my family with all of my fingers intact, and the first in at least three generations never to have worked in front of a lathe. Growing up, I thought blue collar still meant middle class. No longer. At the university I met only one other student whose father worked with his hands.
            
            The wealth of Ann Arbor, the liberal college town just 40 miles west of Detroit, had become stifling. Compared with many Detroiters I was wildly privileged, but at the university I was feeling increasingly distant. I had great friends who were generous, and I felt lucky to get the education I did, but I wanted to use that for something meaningful at home. At the time more than half of UMich students were leaving the state upon graduation, and I didn’t want to be one of them.
            
            If I was going to stay in Michigan, Detroit seemed natural. It was the most important city in the state by any measure, and in some ways it was the most important city in the midwest. In symbolic terms, it’s maybe the most important in America. Henry Ford and Detroit had invented the modern age along with the assembly line. Then, when it was convenient, that line had turned into a conveyor belt dumping Detroit straight into the junkyard of American dreams.
            
            I thought I might be able to use my schooling to help somehow. I naïvely thought, with all the zeal of a well-read 21-year-old white kid, that I could marry my education with my general knowledge of repairing things and fix the biggest project, the ailing city that had loomed over my childhood, as if it were a sink or a roof. I thought I’d just be there for one summer.
